# Day Outline:

## Scratch (or other visual coding environment)
- Day 1: show conversation between two characters, controlled via the BROADCAST block -- use a REPEAT block to have character shrink in size. Work time on short story, for any remaining time. In response to student question, show how you can both glide and shrink simultaneously (via a broadcast command, with two things happening at once).
- Day 2: control character with WASD. Use FOREVER block with changing a characters costume. Play some sounds. [Perhaps do the "if on edge, bounce" block, and have one character follow via the "Point towards" block] Work time on short story, for any remaining time.
- Day 3: Broadcast refresher -- chained broadcasts. Difference between play sound and play sound until done. Point towards mouse block. intro to pen. Class Activity: Experiment with Repeat: no variables today. Work time on short story, for any remaining time. Demo how to submit assignments.
- Day 4: Variables (to improve code from yesterday). Nested Repeat blocks. Sounds, with the TEMPO built in variable. Work time on short story.
- Day 5: Class Activity: Repeat Until. Print out Practice with Repeat Until Sheets. Demo simple "shooting a cannon ball" example -- use an xSpeed and ySpeed variable, and a repeat until block (until the cannon ball hits the ground, by having a y-value less than something).  Work time on RPS, for any remaining time.  **Short story is due.**
- Day 6: Making a start screen. Demo broadcast issues --- have two sprites pick random numbers from 1-100, and a third sprite that says which one chose the highest number. Have a button that initiates the sequence via a broadcast. Screw it up first (all respond to same broadcast, then fix it -- ordered broadcasts). 
- Day 7: If-else intro, in combo with a forever block, to have a character switch colours/some attribute when some condition is triggered (contacting another randomly moving sprite, say). Work time on RPS/Coolest Scratch Assn.
- Day 8: Work time on RPS.
- Day 9: Number Guessing Game [Pair Programming] 
- Day 10: Class Activity: How Many Days are there in a Given Month? Guessing number of seconds elapsed game Demo -- work time on RPS/Coolest Scratch Assn.
- Day 11: Cloud variables (add to game from yesterday?) demo - work time on RPS/Coolest Scratch Assn.
- Day 12: Work time on RPS/Coolest Scratch Assn. -- how to make a side scroller background **Rock Paper Scissors Assignment due**
- Day 13: Work time on Coolest Scratch Assn. -- clones 
- Day 14: Work time on Coolest Scratch Assn. -- making own blocks (jump block?)
- Day 15: Work time on Coolest Scratch Assn.  -- sound/video interaction
- Day 16?: Work time on Coolest Scratch Assn.
- Day 17?: Project Fair? **Coolest Scratch Assignment due**

## Reeborg (or other Karel the Robot clone)
- Days 18-28: GvR Steps, but translated into Reeborg -- steps could easily just be pages of the text, and perhaps mirrored to a separate site if desired...
    - will want to have a note at the start of each of these pages, saying that each step might take less/more than a single class period, but to simply work on them at your own pace, knowing that you need to have them completed within a whatever period of time your teacher has set for you (approximately 10 days of class)
- note that it would probably be a good idea to package reeborg into a nw.js app that can run natively on Windows/Mac/Linux (https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/How-to-package-and-distribute-your-apps)

## Python (or other language of your choice)
- Day 29: Large scale overview of Python -- hit key points, and live code a functional demo. Redo a demo that was already done in Scratch (number guessing game the students made using pair programming?)
- Day 30: Data types. 

Notes to self:
- don't forget to check old edition for exercises: http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html
- consider adding a short section on GUIs at the end (perhaps using appJar - http://appjar.info)
- 



## Additional Modules (to be interspersed throughout the semester)
- Explore the underlying technology of computing devices and the Internet, and their impacts on society.
- Investigate digital security practices and privacy implications.
- Explore computer science related career paths in Saskatchewan, Canada and the world.
- Develop a coding project or conduct research in an area of computer science of the studentâ€™s choice.
