Turtle Drawing Practice
================================

.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    Use ``for`` loops and functions to draw shapes elegantly. Continue working on a Python turtle graphics assignment, focused on repetition and conditionals.

    :showtitle: Curriculum Objectives Addressed In This Section

    - **CS20-CP1** Apply various problem-solving strategies to solve programming problems throughout Computer Science 20.
    - **CS20-FP1** Utilize different data types, including integer, floating point, Boolean and string, to solve programming problems.
    - **CS20-FP2** Investigate how control structures affect program flow.
    - **CS20-FP3** Construct and utilize functions to encapsulate reusable pieces of code.


Practice Problems
-----------------

Inner Squares
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: images/confusion-6.png

Draw the shape above. You may find it helpful to consider how you might draw this shape by defining a new version of ``draw_square()``. Perhaps you might not start in the same location as we did the last time we drew a square?

.. activecode:: practice_problems_1
    :nocodelens:

    import turtle


Square Logo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: images/confusion-7.png

Draw the shape above. Depending on how you defined the ``draw_square()`` function in the problem above, you may be able to easily use reuse your function.

.. activecode:: practice_problems_2
    :nocodelens:

    import turtle


Overlapped Squares
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: images/confusion-8.png

Draw the shape above. Depending on how you defined the ``draw_square()`` function in the problems aboves, you may be able to easily use reuse your function.

.. activecode:: practice_problems_3
    :nocodelens:

    import turtle


Bonus - If You Are Done Before Others
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: images/confusion-14.png

Draw the shape above. Think carefully about how you might be able to draw this elegantly (efficiently and readably)!

.. activecode:: practice_problems_14
    :nocodelens:

    import turtle


Turtle Graphics Assignment
---------------------------

Use the rest of this class time to keep working on your current Python assignment (possibly a turtle graphics drawing, with a focus on looping and conditionals).
