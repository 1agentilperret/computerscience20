Traversal and the ``for`` Loop: By Index
----------------------------------------

It is also possible to use the ``range`` function to systematically generate the indices of the characters.  The ``for`` loop can then be used to iterate over these positions. 
These positions can be used together with the indexing operator to access the individual
characters in the string.

Consider the following codelens example.

.. codelens:: string_for_loop_by_index_1

    fruit = "apple"
    for current_index in range(5):
        current_char = fruit[current_index]
        print(current_char)

The index positions in "apple" are 0,1,2,3 and 4.  This is exactly the same sequence of integers returned by ``range(5)``.  The first time through the for loop, ``current_index`` will be 0 and the "a" will be printed.  Then, ``current_index`` will be reassigned to 1 and "p" will be displayed.  This will repeat for all the range values up to but not including 5.  Since "e" has index 4, this will be exactly right to show all 
of the characters.

In order to make the iteration more general, we can use the ``len`` function to provide the bound for ``range``.  This is a very common pattern for traversing any sequence by position.  Make sure you understand why the range function behaves
correctly when using ``len`` of the string as its parameter value.

.. activecode:: string_for_loop_by_index_2
    :nocanvas:

    fruit = "apple"
    for current_index in range(len(fruit)):
        print(fruit[current_index])


You may also note that iteration by position allows the programmer to control the direction of the
traversal by changing the sequence of index values.  Recall that we can create ranges that count down as 
well as up so the following code will print the characters from right to left.

.. codelens:: string_for_loop_by_index_3

    fruit = "apple"
    for current_index in range(len(fruit)-1, -1, -1):
        print(fruit[current_index])

Trace the values of ``current_index`` and satisfy yourself that they are correct.  In particular, note the start and end of the range.

   How many times is the letter o printed by the following statements?

      sentence = "python rocks"
      for current_index in range(len(sentence)):
          if current_index % 2 == 0:

Practice Problems
------------------

Try the following practice problems. You can either work directly in the textbook, or use Thonny. Either way, copy/paste your finished code into Thonny and save your solution into your Computer Science 20 folder when you finish!

Con Cat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a program that takes in the name of a cat, then prints out a hello message. For example, if the user types in ``Garfield``, your program could print something like ``Good to see you, Garfield!``. **Be sure to use concatenation in your solution!**
   
.. activecode:: practice_problem_string_into_1
    :nocodelens:

    # Hello message to a cat


Duckling Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Robert McCloskey's book *Make Way for Ducklings*, the names of the ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack.  This loop tries to output these names in order.
    
.. activecode:: practice_problem_string_into_2
    :nocodelens:

    prefixes = "JKLMNOPQ"
    suffix = "ack"

    for letter in prefixes:
        # add a conditional statement here...
        print(letter + suffix)
    
    
Of course, that's not quite right because Ouack and Quack are misspelled. See if you can fix it without changing the value of either the ``prefixes`` or ``suffix`` variables! *You should do this by adding a conditional statement within the for loop.*


First Letter of a Word
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: The only thing you need to do for this question is to complete the function definition! **You do not need to call the function**, as that will be done automatically for you.

.. activecode:: practice_problem_string_into_3
    :nocodelens:

    Create a function with a single parameter ``word`` that returns ``True`` if the ``word`` begins with the letter "t" or "c".

    **Examples:**

    ``starts_with_tc("thing") → True``

    ``starts_with_tc("concatenation") → True``

    ``starts_with_tc("warman") → False``
    ~~~~
    def starts_with_tc(word):
        return False

    ====
    from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

    class myTests(TestCaseGui):

        def testOne(self):
            self.assertEqual(starts_with_tc("thing"),True,'starts_with_tc("thing")')
            self.assertEqual(starts_with_tc("concatenation"),True,'starts_with_tc("concatenation")')
            self.assertEqual(starts_with_tc("warman"),False,'starts_with_tc("warman")')
            self.assertEqual(starts_with_tc("Thing"),False,'starts_with_tc("Thing")')
            self.assertEqual(starts_with_tc("candy"),True,'starts_with_tc("candy")')
            self.assertEqual(starts_with_tc("saskatoon"),False,'starts_with_tc("saskatoon")')

    myTests().main()


Password Length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: The only thing you need to do for this question is to complete the function definition! **You do not need to call the function**, as that will be done automatically for you.

.. activecode:: practice_problem_string_into_4
    :nocodelens:

    Create a function with a single parameter ``password`` that returns ``True`` if the ``password`` is between 8 and 32 characters (inclusive), and ``False`` otherwise. *Please note there is much more to a strong password than just the length of the string!*

    **Examples:**

    ``password_length("123456789") → True``

    ``password_length("qwerty") → False``

    ``password_length("cray-topnotch-tampa-anthem-trial") → True``
    ~~~~
    def password_length(password):
        return False

    ====
    from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

    class myTests(TestCaseGui):

        def testOne(self):
            self.assertEqual(password_length("123456789"),True,'password_length("123456789")')
            self.assertEqual(password_length("qwerty"),False,'password_length("qwerty")')
            self.assertEqual(password_length("cray-topnotch-tampa-anthem-trial"),True,'password_length("cray-topnotch-tampa-anthem-trial")')
            self.assertEqual(password_length("7mvRVNwB9JAeVtdWywB3MfGsU6+Rnz4PyVDNCnUt"),False,'password_length("7mvRVNwB9JAeVtdWywB3MfGsU6+Rnz4PyVDNCnUt")')
            self.assertEqual(password_length("fixate"),False,'password_length("fixate")')
            self.assertEqual(password_length("8X?3a739"),True,'password_length("8X?3a739")')

    myTests().main()



Removing the Start and End
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a program that takes in three inputs from the user:

- a word/sentence
- a starting number
- an ending number

After taking in the input, the program should print out a portion of the word/sentence that was entered. For example, if the word the user entered was ``Saskatchewan``, the starting number was 3 and the ending number was 2, the program should print ``katchew``. Notice that in the output, it is the same as the word, except that the first 3 characters and last 2 characters have been removed.

To be sure you understand the challenge, consider the following example:

- word = "unimaginatively"
- starting_number = 3
- ending_number = 2
- output should be ``maginative``


.. activecode:: practice_problem_string_into_5
    :nocodelens:

    # Remove the Start and End
