Turtle Confusion Challenges
============================

The following images will provide you a chance to think through the logic of how to draw a particular image. It is a great challenge to try to think through the solution completely first, then write the code. Challenge yourself to have your code work correctly the first time it runs!

.. note:: These images, and the riddles that accompany them, are included with the permission of Barry Newell. They are from Barry's book *Turtle Confusion* (1988). 

.. warning:: To do: add some restrictions/instructions on how the images should be drawn.

Use at least one variable to make it easy to change the size of the square.

    There was a young student named Myrtle,

    Who tried to converse with the Turtle,

    She later said, "Guys,
    
    The scales fall from your eyes,
    
    When you clear the homology hurdle."

Use the ``for`` loop structure when drawing this rectangle. Consider the ways the rectangle is the same as a square, and the ways it is different. 

    A butterfly floated delicately down and alighted on a branch near a hungry caterpillar. The butterfly, peering down its proboscis at the caterpillar, said, "Move aside, you uncouth beast."

    The caterpillar looked up from its munching and said, in a rather muffled, mouth-fullish way, "You might think that you are special, My Lady, but consider your origins. Also, I ask that you remember my versatility; can you, My Lady, ...BURP, pardon me... perform the Big Change?"

It might help if you regarded this shape as a rectangle with a chunk bitten out of the corner. See if you can draw the shape with the bite taken out of a different corner as well. Sometimes you can solve these puzzles in a nice, simple way; other times, you can't. Looking for a pattern to write a simple solution can usually help you learn something, though!

.. note:: The small triangle indicates the corner which the turtle should start and end when the Hollow C is drawn. Make sure that the turtle is pointing in the same direction at the beginning and end.

Let's draw the image three different ways:

- using any commands that you like
- using only the ``.forward()`` and ``.right()`` commands
- using ``.forward()``, ``.backward()``, and ``.right(90)`` (note that you may use 90, and only 90, as the argument to the ``.right()`` command for this solution)

    Said Senator Seemore, "I'm feeling ambivalent,

    I've come to believe all parties equivalent,

    Even those at extremes of political persuasion,

    Tend to create the same State of the Nation."

What does this puzzle have in common with:

    A barque, but not a schooner?

    A steak with three veg., but not a can of beans? 

    *The Four Seasons*, but not *Yellow Submarine*? 

    A reef knot, but not a turk's head?

Go back to the code you wrote for the first 5 images, and turn them each into functions, so that you can call something like ``my_turtle.square(100)``.

    Have you ever thought about the way a pizza, 

    As you wrap yourself around each tasty wedge, 

    Is eaten in the manner cakes and sweets are,

    We consume them from the middle to the edge.

A **pointer** is a riddle that has a single number as its solution; the number is the sequence-number of another puzzle on this page. In some cases the related puzzle will be a harder puzzle, in some cases it will be an easier puzzle. Consider the following pointer:

    "If they explode enough uranium devices,

    Our planet will become somewhat exciting,

    We may end up with glowing herbs and spices, 

    And bones that give a soft internal lighting."

If you are struggling with the shapes we are drawing, don't worry too much about making the solution to this problem elegant. However, if you are feeling confident, see if you can think through how you might be able to draw this shape in a different, simpler way.

    You are better off thinking of a *llama* on a *llano*, than you are contemplating the Cyclops's barbershop quartet.

    The bugs are all dead, you feel like you're Lister, 

    You've a puzzle for Clio, one more for each sister, 

    And then you find out, from a Flatlander sentry, 

    That you and the Turtle have views supplementary.
