Your First Python Program!
==========================


What is Python?
---------------

Actually, you've already been writing Python programs. Now, however, you get to do so without having everything tied to the visual output that we've seen so far. This allows us to start exploring other ways our programs can produce output, and take input.

ActiveCode
----------

.. activecode:: codeexample1
   :coach:
   :caption: This is a caption

   print("My first program adds a list of numbers")
   myList = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
   total = 0
   for num in myList:
       total = total + num
   print(total)

Multiple Choice
---------------

.. mchoice:: question1_2
    :multiple_answers:
    :correct: a,b,d
    :answer_a: red
    :answer_b: yellow
    :answer_c: black
    :answer_d: green
    :feedback_a: Red is a definitely on of the colors.
    :feedback_b: Yes, yellow is correct.
    :feedback_c: Remember the acronym...ROY G BIV.  B stands for blue.
