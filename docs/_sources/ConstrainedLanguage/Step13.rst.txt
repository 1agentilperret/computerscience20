Step 13: Walk Around the Lake
===============================================

Project

Open Step 13a on the `Reeborg website <http://wmcicompsci.ca/reeborg>`_ .

Reeborg loves going for walks, especially when it is around a lake. The lakes in Reeborg's neighborhood are all different sizes of rectangles, so Reeborg does not know how many steps it will take to get back to the start of walk. Thankfully, Reeborg happens to be carrying a banana, which you can tell Reeborg to ``put()`` down at the start of it's walk. Reeborg knows it's done walking when it reaches the banana again.

Use a ``while`` statement (looking for the banana object) and an ``if/else`` to have Reeborg complete his walking adventure.

.. note:: Reeborg cannot use a ``repeat`` statement, since it has no idea of the dimensions of the lake it is walking around.


Extra for Experts
------------------

Reeborg has found a much more interesting lake to walk around.

Try to adapt the solution for the basic world to also work with this new lake. Reeborg should once again put down the banana at the starting position and continue walking along the border of the lake until it finds the banana again. Staying along the wall will be trickier this time, but that's the challenge!

.. note:: Your solution for the Extra for Experts world should also work in the basic (Step 13a) world!
