Reeborg's world is a simple grid, and we can refer to any part of the grid using an x and y coordinate. This is the same as a Cartesian plane from math class! In this world, Reeborg needs to get back home, which is at x=5 and y=1, or (5,1).


Your Turn
---------

Open Step 1 on the `Reeborg website <http://wmcicompsci.ca/reeborg>`_ .
