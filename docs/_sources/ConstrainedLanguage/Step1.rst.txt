Step 1: Move Reeborg Home and Saving Your Work
==============================================

Tutorial
--------

In some worlds, Reeborg may have a specific place he needs to get to. For example, when you open the Step 1 world, you will see an image of Reeborg's home.

Reeborg's world is a simple grid, and we can refer to any part of the grid using an x and y coordinate. This is the same as a Cartesian plane from math class! In this world, Reeborg needs to get back home, which is at x=5 and y=1, or (5,1).

Although the code you are creating for this first few worlds is quite simple, as you progress to the more difficult steps, you will want to save your code. **To save the code** you have created, you need to click on "Additional Options", then under the *Program Editor* section, enter in a program name (such as **step5a**.py), then click the "Save program to file" button. You should now be able to open the text file on your computer (use a text editor like Notepad++ or Atom). You can load your code back onto the website using the "Import program from file" button in the same section.
