.. Here is where you specify the content and order of your new book.

.. Each section heading (e.g. "SECTION 1: A Random Section") will be
   a heading in the table of contents. Source files that should be
   generated and included in that section should be placed on individual
   lines, with one line separating the first source filename and the
   :maxdepth: line.

.. Sources can also be included from subfolders of this directory.
   (e.g. "DataStructures/queues.rst").

Computer Science 20 - Saskatchewan
----------------------------------

.. warning:: This textbook is currently being written, so things will change/be added for the next few months. The only section that is currently complete is Reeborg (though some updates will be made to Reeborg in February). For the Scratch unit, the order and headings of the content is correct, but very little text has been written to accompany the video tutorials for that section. If you spot any errors, please `let me know! <mailto:schellenberg@gmail.com>`_
