Making Your Own Blocks (Functions)
====================================

.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    Define your own blocks in Scratch. Create a block that says a random greeting (no argument required), then create a block that draws a polygon with a certain number of sides (argument required).

If you'd prefer to watch a video, `the following video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXH0WTfA5eo>`_ demonstrates the same ideas as what I've described in text below.
