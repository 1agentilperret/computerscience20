Repeat Until
============

Class Activity: Repeat Until. Print out Practice with Repeat Until Sheets. Demo simple "shooting a cannon ball" example -- use an xSpeed and ySpeed variable, and a repeat until block (until the cannon ball hits the ground, by having a y-value less than something).  Work time on RPS, for any remaining time.  **Short story is due.**


.. warning:: This is just a stub, to give a sense of what should go here. It will be written up properly soon...
