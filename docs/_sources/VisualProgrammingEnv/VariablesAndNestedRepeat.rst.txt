Drawing Polygons - Part 2 (Variables and Nested Repeat)
=======================================================

.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    Use **variables** to improve the polygon drawing from last lesson. Refactor the code from yesterday so a regular polygon with any number of sides can be drawn with the same code. Explore interesting shapes using **nested loops** (a loop inside another loop).

Variables
---------

Variables (to improve code from yesterday). 


Nested Repeat blocks
--------------------

Nested Repeat blocks -- polygons, with rotation. 


Work time on short story.
