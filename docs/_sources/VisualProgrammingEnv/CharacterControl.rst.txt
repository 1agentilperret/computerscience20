Controlling a Character with WASD (Repetition and Conditionals)
===============================================================

.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    Introduce the **repeat** block by having a sprite shrink before disappearing. Demonstrate simple event-driven programming by moving a sprite with WASD using the **when key pressed** block. Use the **forever** block, combined with the **if-then** block to improve the motion of the sprite.

If you'd prefer to watch a video describing how to create your first Scratch program, `the following video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvGC6Sr6rvU>`_ demonstrates the same ideas as what I've described in text below.

Adapting Project From Yesterday
-------------------------------

Adapt previous project to have the characters shrink before they disappear. 


Control a Character Using WASD - Version 1
------------------------------------------

Then control character with WASD. Do this in multiple versions -- first with jittery motion (When Key is Pressed), then...


Control a Character Using WASD - Version 2
------------------------------------------
WASD smoothly (FOREVER block, using if statements)


Work time on first assignment [short story], for any remaining time.
