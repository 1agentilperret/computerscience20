Number Guessing Game (Pair Programming)
=======================================

This will be your first foray into pair programming. One of you should be at the keyboard and mouse, while the other partner is helping discuss the ideas. Switch roles every 10 minutes. 

For this assignment, you will create a game that does the following:

- generates a random number from 1 to 100
- repeats the following until the user guesses the number
- gets the user to guess the number
- tells the user if the number is too high or too low
- congratulates the user when they guess the correct number with a message such as "Way to go! You guessed the right number in 9 tries!"

When you complete the basic functionality, put up your hand and I'll tell you how you can make it even better! [Note to self: WAY too..., STILL too..., very close, but it's too..., CPU/human reverse roles..., specific number of attempts...]


.. warning:: This is just a stub, to give a sense of what should go here. It will be written up properly soon...
