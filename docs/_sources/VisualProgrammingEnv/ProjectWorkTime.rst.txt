Project Work Period
===================

.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    Work period to put the concepts learned so far into practice. Your teacher will have you create a project that uses most of the ideas seen so far -- a Rock Paper Scissors game is a nice option.

.. warning:: This is just a stub, to give a sense of what should go here. It will be written up properly soon...

We won't be learning anything new today. Instead, you will be given time to try to build a project that puts to use many of the ideas that we've seen so far.
