Project Work Period
===================

.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    Work periods to put the concepts learned so far into practice. You can choose to create anything you'd like, so long as the project you choose demonstrates that you understand the ideas we've studied.

.. warning:: This is just a stub, to give a sense of what should go here. It will be written up properly soon...

We won't be learning anything new today. Instead, you will be given time to try to build a project that puts to use many of the ideas that we've seen so far.
