Project Overview
=================

Outcome
--------------

Develop a coding project or conduct research in an area of computer science of the studentâ€™s choice.


Indicators
--------------

Add some project ideas here. Curriculum indicators are:


* Create a proposal document including discussion of basic premise, key
  features and project team members (e.g., individual or pairs).

* Construct a tool (e.g., rubric, checklist, self-evaluation form or peer-
  evaluation form) to assess the process and products involved in a student-
  directed study.

* Create a project using the same or a different programming language than
  those used in Computer Science 20.

* Research the application of computer science in other fields (e.g., art,
  trades, sciences, mathematics and medicine).

* Research the current state and/or societal implications of a current trend
  in computing such as hacking, artificial intelligence, robotics,
  microcontrollers, game design, cryptography, mobile development or
  intellectual property.

* Present the research or project to peers.
