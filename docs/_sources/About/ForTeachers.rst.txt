How to Use This Textbook - For Teachers
============================================

Introduction
----------------------------

Not sure what needs to be put in here for teachers. A bit of help, implementation support team? Some things I'm thinking of including:

- that each page roughly maps to one day's worth of instruction (with the notable exception of the Reeborg unit)
- what to do if you have junky internet access
- download links for Thonny (for Python section), Notepad++ (to view Reeborg steps, and any other plain text you want)
- 

Sample Overview of Days
------------------------

When I was creating this textbook (in the fall of 2017), I kept track of what I did each day below.

Scratch
~~~~~~~
#. Introduction to Scratch (Broadcasts)

#. Tracing Code and Cannonball Motion (Repeat Until)
#. Making a Start Screen (Repeat, If/Else, Broadcast)
#. Project Work Period
#. Timing Issues and Dodging Game (Broadcasts and Variables)
#. Built-In Variables (Tempo, Answer and Timer)
#. Project Work Period
#. Number Guessing Game (Pair Programming)
#. Making Your Own Blocks (Functions)
#. Number Guessing Game (Pair Programming)
#. Student Directed Project Work Period
#. Student Directed Project Work Period

Reeborg
~~~~~~~

Note that this is hard to pin down to exactly what students will get through, since they all work through this section at a different pace. We started on a Tuesday, and I've asked them to all be done step 9 (if they aren't already) by Monday. 

Still going through this. I'm thinking approximately two weeks to get through this, but to keep the keen students interested, that might mean creating a few "extra challenges" that aren't required...
