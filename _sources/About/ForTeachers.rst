How to Use This Textbook - For Students
============================================

Introduction
----------------------------

Welcome here! The goal of this course is to teach you how to problem solve, and we will be using the concepts of Computer Science to achieve that goal. By the end of the semester, you will be able to confidently solve problems by writing computer programs. In other words, you will be able to control what the computer does by writing algorithms (a series of steps). 

Although we will eventually get to writing plain text into a file to create computer programs, that process can be a bit intimidating. To help you understand what you are able to teach a computer to do, we will follow the following process:

- use a visual programming environment (this will allow you to understand the basic control structures of computer science, and will prevent you from making any syntax errors that would cause your program to report an error when you run it)
- use a constrained language to solve algorithmic puzzles (here you will type in text to control what the computer is doing, which means you will run into syntax errors, but the puzzles you are solving will give you instant visual feedback)
- use a "traditional" computer science language (once you are feeling confident with many of the basic ideas of computer science, we will apply them using a traditional computer language)


Your First Computer Program!
----------------------------

There are many different visual programming environments, but the one we will use is called `Scratch <https://scratch.mit.edu/>`_. Your first task is to create an account on the Scratch website, so that the programs you write can be saved and accessed later. Go do that now!
