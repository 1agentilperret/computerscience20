Tracing Code and Cannonball Motion (Repeat Until)
=================================================

.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    Introduce the **repeat until** block by tracing code with simple variables and conditionals. Use the repeat until block to simulate the motion of a cannon ball (motion repeats until the cannon ball hits the ground).

Class Activity: Repeat Until
-----------------------------

Print out the :download:`Practice with Repeat Until Practice handout <handouts/scratch_repeat_until_practice.pdf>`. 

.. note:: If you would like to edit the Repeat Until Practice handout, download the :download:`editable Word document <handouts/scratch_repeat_until_practice.docx>`.



Demonstrating How to Use Repeat Until
-------------------------------------

Demo simple "shooting a cannon ball" example -- use an xSpeed and ySpeed variable, and a repeat until block (until the cannon ball hits the ground, by having a y-value less than something).  

Work time on RPS, for any remaining time.  **Short story is due.**
