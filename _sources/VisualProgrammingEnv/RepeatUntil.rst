Repeat Until
============

.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    Introduce the **repeat until** block by tracing code with simple variables and conditionals. Use the repeat until block to simulate the motion of a cannon ball (motion repeats until the cannon ball hits the ground).

If you'd prefer to watch a video, `the following video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jTHwZCY2CI>`_ demonstrates the same ideas as what I've described in text below.

Class Activity: Repeat Until. Print out Practice with Repeat Until Sheets. 

Demo simple "shooting a cannon ball" example -- use an xSpeed and ySpeed variable, and a repeat until block (until the cannon ball hits the ground, by having a y-value less than something).  

Work time on RPS, for any remaining time.  **Short story is due.**
