Timing Issues and Dodging Game (Broadcasts and Variables)
=========================================================

.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    Explore issues that arise when more than one script is triggered by the same event, and solve them by setting up ordered broadcasts. Create an object dodging game, using variables to allow both the object and character to increase in speed as the game progresses.

Timing Issues
-------------

Demo broadcast issues --- have two sprites pick random numbers from 1-100, and a third sprite that says which one chose the highest number. Have a button that initiates the sequence via a broadcast. Screw it up first (all respond to same broadcast, then fix it -- ordered broadcasts).  


Dodging Game
------------

Create a dodging game, in which the object to avoid (bouncing randomly around the screen) and the character (which is following the mouse) both speed up as the game progresses. When they contact each other, the game should end.
