Broadcast Issues and Chasing Game
=================================

Demo broadcast issues --- have two sprites pick random numbers from 1-100, and a third sprite that says which one chose the highest number. Have a button that initiates the sequence via a broadcast. Screw it up first (all respond to same broadcast, then fix it -- ordered broadcasts).  

If-else review, in combo with a forever block, to have a character switch colours/some attribute when some condition is triggered (contacting another randomly moving sprite, say). Keep track of number of times it has contacted in a variable. Update the variable by sending a broadcast?

Work time on RPS/Coolest Scratch Assn.


.. warning:: This is just a stub, to give a sense of what should go here. It will be written up properly soon...
