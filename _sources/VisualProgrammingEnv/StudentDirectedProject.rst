Student Directed Project
========================

.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    Work periods to put the concepts learned so far into practice. You can choose to create anything you'd like, so long as the project you choose demonstrates that you understand the ideas we've studied.

    :showtitle: Curriculum Objectives Addressed In This Section

    - **CS20-CP1** Apply various problem-solving strategies to solve programming problems throughout Computer Science 20.
    - **CS20-FP1** Utilize different data types, including integer, floating point, Boolean and string, to solve programming problems.
    - **CS20-FP2** Investigate how control structures affect program flow.
    - **CS20-SD1** Develop a coding project or conduct research in an area of computer science of the studentâ€™s choice.


.. warning:: This is just a stub, to give a sense of what should go here. It will be written up properly soon...

We won't be demonstrating anything new during these periods. Instead, you will be given time to try to build a project that puts to use many of the ideas that we've seen so far. 

Be sure that the project you choose allows you to demonstrate your understanding of:

- broadcast (to control program flow)
- loops (repeat, repeat until, forever blocks)
- conditionals (if, if/else blocks)
- variables
