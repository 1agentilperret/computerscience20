Conditionals Introduction
=========================

If-else intro, in combo with a forever block, to have a character switch colours/some attribute when some condition is triggered (contacting another randomly moving sprite, say). Work time on RPS/Coolest Scratch Assn.


.. warning:: This is just a stub, to give a sense of what should go here. It will be written up properly soon...
