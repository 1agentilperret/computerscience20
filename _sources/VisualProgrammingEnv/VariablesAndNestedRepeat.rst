===========================

If you'd prefer to watch a video, `the following video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV9GjD7-dg8>`_ demonstrates the same ideas as what I've described in text below.

Variables
---------

Variables (to improve code from yesterday). 


Nested Repeat blocks
--------------------

Nested Repeat blocks -- polygons, with rotation. Perhaps also a pinwheel (as seen here: http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/3-blocks-with-inputs.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment). Work time on short story.


.. warning:: This is just a stub, to give a sense of what should go here. It will be written up properly soon...
