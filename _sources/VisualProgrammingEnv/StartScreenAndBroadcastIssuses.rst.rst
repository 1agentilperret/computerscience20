Start Screen and Common Broadcast Issues
========================================

Making a start screen. Demo broadcast issues --- have two sprites pick random numbers from 1-100, and a third sprite that says which one chose the highest number. Have a button that initiates the sequence via a broadcast. Screw it up first (all respond to same broadcast, then fix it -- ordered broadcasts). 


.. warning:: This is just a stub, to give a sense of what should go here. It will be written up properly soon...
