Visual Programming Environment
==============================

Introduction
----------------------------

Welcome here! The goal of this course is to teach you how to problem solve, and we will be using the concepts of Computer Science to achieve that goal. By the end of the semester, you will be able to confidently solve problems by writing computer programs. In other words, you will be able to control what the computer does by writing algorithms (a series of steps). 

Although we will eventually get to writing plain text into a file to create computer programs, that process can be a bit intimidating. To help you understand what you are able to teach a computer to do, we will follow the following process:

- use a visual programming environment (this will allow you to understand the basic control structures of computer science, and will prevent you from making any syntax errors that would cause your program to report an error when you run it)
- use a constrained language to solve algorithmic puzzles (here you will type in text to control what the computer is doing, which means you will run into syntax errors, but the puzzles you are solving will give you instant visual feedback)
- use a "regular" computer science language (once you are feeling confident with many of the basic ideas of computer science, we will apply them using a traditional computer language)


Your First Computer Program!
----------------------------

There are many different visual programming environments, but the one we will use is called `Scratch <https://scratch.mit.edu/>`_. Your first task is to create an account on the Scratch website, so that the programs you write can be saved and accessed later. 

Now that you have an account, let's make your first computer program of the semester! Click the Create button on the top of the Scratch website to create a new project.

In the project view, the screen is divided into a number of panes, including the stage (where you will see your project run), sprite list (shows which sprites are part of your project, and allows you to select them), block palette (where all the blocks you can drag-and-drop onto your scripts), and the scripts area (where you will combine blocks of code to create programs for your sprites to run). One of the most important things for you to keep in mind is that *you can't break the environment*, so feel free to explore as much as you want!

For our first program, let's create a simple conversation between two sprites.
