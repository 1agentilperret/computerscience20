Adapting Project From Yesterday
-------------------------------

Adapt previous project to have the characters shrink before they disappear. 


Control a Character Using WASD - Version 1
------------------------------------------

Then control character with WASD. Do this in multiple versions -- first with jittery motion (When Key is Pressed), then...


Control a Character Using WASD - Version 2
------------------------------------------
WASD smoothly (FOREVER block, using if statements)


Possible Extensions
-------------------

Use FOREVER block with changing a characters costume. Work time on first assignment [short story], for any remaining time.
