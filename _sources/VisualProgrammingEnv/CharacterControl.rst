Controlling a Character with WASD
=================================

Control character with WASD. Use FOREVER block with changing a characters costume. Play some sounds. [Perhaps do the "if on edge, bounce" block, and have one character follow via the "Point towards" block] Work time on short story, for any remaining time.


.. warning:: This is just a stub, to give a sense of what should go here. It will be written up properly soon...
