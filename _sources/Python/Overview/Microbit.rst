    - **CS20-CP1** Apply various problem-solving strategies to solve programming problems throughout Computer Science 20.
    - **CS20-FP1** Utilize different data types, including integer, floating point, Boolean and string, to solve programming problems.
    - **CS20-FP2** Investigate how control structures affect program flow.


.. warning:: This is just a stub, to show what should go here. It will be written up properly later. The install process for bitio is also really awkward right now. It will be improved to use the "Manage Packages..." menu soon.


Download the `bitio module <https://github.com/whaleygeek/bitio/archive/master.zip>`_. This lets you use a BBC Micro:bit to sense the physical world around you, and to output to LEDs (and much more, if you hook up sensors).

First, run some of the example code in the folder you just downloaded. Then, see if you can make a turtle that is controlled by tilting the Micro:bit!
