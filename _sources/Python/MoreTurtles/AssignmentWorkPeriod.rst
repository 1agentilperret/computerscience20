    - **CS20-CP1** Apply various problem-solving strategies to solve programming problems throughout Computer Science 20.
    - **CS20-FP1** Utilize different data types, including integer, floating point, Boolean and string, to solve programming problems.
    - **CS20-FP2** Investigate how control structures affect program flow.
    - **CS20-FP3** Construct and utilize functions to encapsulate reusable pieces of code.


Practice Problem

Draw the shape above. You can choose to either:

- create a function, and repeatedly call that function
- use repetition without a function (if you choose this method, you will want to use a nested ``for`` loop)

Turtle Graphics Assignment
---------------------------

Use the rest of this class time to keep working on your current Python assignment (possibly a turtle graphics drawing, with a focus on looping and conditionals).
