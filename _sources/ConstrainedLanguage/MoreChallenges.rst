More Challenges
================

If you have finished off all of steps 1 - 17, and are waiting for your classmates to catch up, take a look at the following challenges. Some of them will require you to do a fair bit of thinking before you begin to code! You will likely find it helpful to think them through with paper/pencil before attempting to write out a solution on the computer.


Star Towers - Version 1
------------------------

Reeborg loves to build - today it is making Star Towers. It has plenty of stars, and wants to make towers that are 3 stars high. Write a program that creates a Star Tower at Reeborg's starting position, and every other x-position after that (odd x-values).

Open the |star_tower1| to implement your solution!

The world will look something like this at the start:

.. image:: images/star_tower1_start.png

When your program is done, the ending world should look like this:

.. image:: images/star_tower1_end.png


Star Towers - Version 2
------------------------

This time Reeborg wants to build star towers in a cave. There are stalactites on the roof of the cave of differing length, so Reeborg wants to make it's towers as tall as it can without bumping into them. Like last time, write a program that creates a Star Tower at Reeborgâ€™s starting position, and every other x-position after that (odd x-values). The height of each Star Tower should allow for one empty square beneath the stalactites.

The world will look something like this at the start:

When your program is done, the ending world should look like this:

Target Practice
----------------

Reeborg decides to spend the day practicing its archery skills. Somewhere in the world is a triangular object. Write a program so that allows Reeborg to find this object, and then have it create cross hairs that span the whole world and centre on that target.

The world will look something like this at the start:

Find the Center - Version 1
----------------------------

Put down a token in the geometrical center of the following world. You are guaranteed that the **width** of the world will be an odd number, and that it will only be one unit tall.

Open the |find_center_1| to implement your solution!

The world will look something like this at the start:

Find the Center - Version 2
----------------------------

Put down a token in the geometrical center of the following world. You are guaranteed that the **width and height** of the world will be odd numbers.


Open the |find_center_2| to implement your solution!
