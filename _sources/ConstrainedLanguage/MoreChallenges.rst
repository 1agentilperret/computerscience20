More Challenges
================

If you have finished off all of steps 1 - 17, and are waiting for your classmates to catch up, take a look at the following challenges. Some of them will require you to do a fair bit of thinking before you begin to code! You will likely find it helpful to think them through with paper/pencil before attempting to write out a solution on the computer.


Star Towers - Version 1
------------------------

Reeborg loves to build - today it is making Star Towers. It has plenty of stars, and wants to make towers that are 3 stars high. Write a program that creates a Star Tower at Reeborg's starting position, and every other x-position after that (odd x-values).

Open the |star_tower1| to implement your solution!

Put down a token in the geometrical center of the following world. You are guaranteed that the **width** of the world will be an odd number, and that it will only be one unit tall.

Load the worlds by running the following code in the Python Code tab::

    World("src/worlds/tutorial_en/center1.json", "Find Center 1")
    World("src/worlds/tutorial_en/center2.json", "Find Center 2")

Find the Center - Version 2
----------------------------

Put down a token in the geometrical center of the following world. You are guaranteed that the **width and height** of the world will be odd numbers.


Load the worlds by running the following code in the Python Code tab::

    World("src/worlds/tutorial_en/center3.json", "Find Center 3")
