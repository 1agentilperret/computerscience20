Step 1: Move Reeborg Home
=========================

Open Step 1 on the `Reeborg website <http://wmcicompsci.ca/reeborg>`_ .

In some worlds, Reeborg may have a specific place he needs to get to. For example, when you open the Step 1 world, you will see an image of Reeborg's home.

Reeborg's world is a simple grid, and we can refer to any part of the grid using an x and y coordinate. This is the same as a Cartesian plane from math class! In this world, Reeborg needs to get back home, which is at x=5 and y=1, or (5,1).

Give Reeborg the appropriate instructions to make him return home!
