Project Overview
=================

Outcome
--------------

Develop a coding project and/or research a topic related to computer science of the student's choice.


Indicators For This Outcome
------------------------------

* Create a proposal document for a coding project that includes discussion of the basic premise or problem to be solved, key features and project team members and their roles.

* Construct a tool (e.g., rubric, checklist, self-evaluation form or peer-evaluation form) to assess the process and products involved in a student-directed study.

* Develop a coding project using the same or a different programming language than those used in Computer Science 20.

* Examine an area of collaborative research between computer science and another field.

* Research the application of computer science in other fields (e.g., art, trades, sciences, mathematics and medicine).

* Inquire into the current state and/or societal implications of a current trend in computing such as hacking, artificial intelligence, robotics, microcontrollers, game design, cryptography, mobile development or intellectual property.

* Present the research or project to peers.
