# Thoughts on the SK Comp Sci 20 textbook:

- there are already some really good textbooks to introduce Comp Sci (How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, etc)
- the niche I think could be filled is a textbook well structured for a high school Comp Sci course
    + begin with "block based" language (2-3 weeks)
    + use a constrained language as a bridge to the language of your choice (some type of Karel the Robot port for the language you are going to use) (2 weeks)
    + THEN incorporate the content from a book like How to Think Like a Computer Scientist (rest of semester)
    + include modules at the end of the book, which should be incorporated in small chunks throughout the semester: (this is where I'm concerned about link rot over time, and where most content will need to be created from scratch)
        * CS20-CS1 Explore the underlying technology of computing devices and the Internet, and their impacts on society. **(any ideas on this part would be greatly appreciated)**
        * CS20-CS2 Investigate digital security practices and privacy implications. **(any ideas on this part would be greatly appreciated)**
        * CS20-CE1 Explore computer science related career paths in Saskatchewan, Canada and the world. **(any ideas on this part would be greatly appreciated)**
        * CS20-SD1 Develop a coding project or conduct research in an area of computer science of the studentâ€™s choice. **(any ideas on this part would be greatly appreciated)**
- the structure of the book might be more helpful to a beginner teacher if it is set up where each page (section in printed version) is roughly correlated to the amount you can get through in a single class (rather than organizing it according to traditional topics)
