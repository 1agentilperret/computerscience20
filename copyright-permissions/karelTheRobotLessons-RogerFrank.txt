    Absolutely yes you have my permission. If you need something in writing just ask and give me an address. 

    I trust you've seen the computer labs at rfrank.net also.

    P.S. I love to visit Saskatchewan. 

    All the best.

    Hi Mr. Frank,

    I am writing a high school textbook for computer science (in Saskatchewan, Canada), and am wondering if I could adapt the Karel the Robot Lessons you created. The textbook will be available for free, under a Creative Commons BY-SA license. 

    Thanks for your consideration!
