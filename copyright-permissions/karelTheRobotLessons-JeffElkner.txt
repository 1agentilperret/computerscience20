    You don't need my permission to do that, Dan (that's what freedom is all about ;-), but I can offer you my full and enthusiastic blessing!

    Hi Jeff,

    I am writing a high school textbook for computer science (in Saskatchewan, Canada), and am wondering if I could adapt the GvR Lessons you adapted from Roger Frank. The textbook will be available for free, under a Creative Commons BY-SA license. 

    Thanks for your consideration!
